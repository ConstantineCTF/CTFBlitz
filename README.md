CTFBlitz: Elite CTF Toolkit
CTFBlitz is a Python-based, menu-driven toolkit for crushing Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges on TryHackMe and HackTheBox. With dual Normal/Advanced modes, Stealth Mode with random delays, customizable themes, and CTF-focused tools, itâ€™s your ultimate weapon for sniping flags and flexing on GitHub!
Features

Quick Recon: Scans ports like Nmap. Normal: Top 100 or custom range (e.g., 80-100, ~5s). Advanced: All ports, vulns (e.g., CVE-2021-41773, ~1â€“2m).
Web Vuln Deep Dive: Hunts web bugs like Burp Suite. Normal: Headers, 10 paths (10s). Advanced: Crawls links, 100+ paths, params (1â€“2m).
Mega Brute-Forcer: Cracks logins. Normal: 50 CTF creds, 1000 usernames (~5â€“10s). Advanced: 10,000 passwords (rockyou_small.txt, ~1â€“2m).
Flag Finder: Snipes flags (e.g., flag{1234}). Normal: One file/URL, suggests formats (flag{.}, HTB{.}, 5s). Advanced: Crawls HTML/JS (30s).
Hidden File Scanner: Finds secret files (e.g., /flag.txt). Normal: 10 files (5â€“10s). Advanced: 100+ files, tries .bak, .txt, .zip (30â€“60s).
Hint Decoder: Cracks hints. Normal: Base64, hex (2â€“5s). Advanced: ROT13, URL, Caesar (5â€“10s).
Toggle Mode: Switch Normal (fast) or Advanced (deep) globally.
View Results: Session dashboard of findings (ports, flags, creds).
Manage Config Profiles: Save/load CTF setups (IPs, wordlists).
Stealth Mode: Random delays (0.5â€“2s) to avoid detection.
Quick Help: Hacker-style guide for all features.
Themes: Customize colors (Hacker Green, Cyber Blue, Red Team).

Setup

Clone the repo: git clone <your-repo-url>
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Copy common.txt from dirb: cp /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt data/
Download usernames.txt (1000 usernames, e.g., from seclists on GitHub) to data/.
Create rockyou_small.txt: head -n 10000 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt > data/rockyou_small.txt
Ensure data/ is writable for ctf_results.json, config.json, ctf_log.txt.
Run with sudo for Advanced Recon (uses -O): sudo python ctfblitz.py

Usage

Run python ctfblitz.py to start the menu.
Choose 0â€“11 for features, toggle modes, or view help.
Customize theme in ctfblitz.py (set theme to "Hacker Green", "Cyber Blue", or "Red Team").
Results save to data/ctf_results.json, logs to data/ctf_log.txt.
Adjust "login failed" check in brute_force.py for specific CTF login pages.

Notes

Tested on Kali Linux with Python 3.9+.
Use on TryHackMe/HackTheBox VMs only.
Download usernames.txt from seclists (GitHub) and common.txt from dirb.
Create rockyou_small.txt for faster Advanced brute-forcing.
Check ctf_log.txt for debugging.

Pwn those flags, boss! ðŸ˜Ž
